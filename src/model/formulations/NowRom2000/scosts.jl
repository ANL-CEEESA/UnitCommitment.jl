    _add_startup_cost_eqs!

Based on Nowak and RÃ¶misch, 2000.
Introduces auxiliary startup cost variable, c_g^SU(t) for each time period,
and uses startup status variable, u_g(t);
there are exponentially many facets in this space,
but there is a linear-time separation algorithm (Brandenburg et al., 2017).
