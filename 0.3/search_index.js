If Startup costs ($) and Startup delays (h) are set to [300.0, 400.0] and [1, 4], for example, and the generator is shut down at time 00:00 (h:min), then it costs $300 to start up the generator at any time between 01:00 and 03:59, and $400 to start the generator at time 04:00 or any time after that.  The number of startup cost points is unlimited, and may be different for each generator. Startup delays must be strictly increasing and the first entry must equal Minimum downtime (h).

For example, if the generator is producing 100 MW at time step 1 and this parameter is set to 40 MW, then the generator will produce at least 60 MW at time step 2. +inf N\nStartup limit (MW) Maximum amount of power a generator can produce immediately after starting up (in MW). For example, if Startup limit (MW) is set to 100 MW and the unit is off at time step 1, then it may produce at most 100 MW at time step 2. +inf N\nShutdown limit (MW) Maximum amount of power a generator can produce immediately before shutting down (in MW). Specifically, the generator can only shut down at time step t+1 if its production at time step t is below this limit. +inf N\nInitial status (h) If set to a positive number, indicates the amount of time (in hours) the generator has been on at the beginning of the simulation, and if set to a negative number, the amount of time the generator has been off. For example, if Initial status (h) is -2, this means that the generator was off since -02:00 (h:min). The simulation starts at time 00:00. If Initial status (h) is 3, this means that the generator was on since -03:00. A value of zero is not acceptable.

For example,  if Production cost curve (MW) is set to [5.0, [10.0, 12.0, 15.0, 20.0]], then the unit may generate at most 10, 12, 15 and 20 MW of power during time steps 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The minimum output for all time periods is fixed to at 5 MW.\nThere is no limit to the number of piecewise-linear segments, and different generators may have a different number of segments.\nIf Production cost curve (MW) and Production cost curve ($) both contain a single element, then the generator must produce exactly that amount of power when operational. To specify that the generator may produce any amount of power up to a certain limit P, the parameter Production cost curve (MW) should be set to [0, P]. \nProduction cost curves must be convex.","category":"page"},{"location":"format/#Example-3","page":"Data Format","title":"Example","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"format/","page":"Data Format","title":"Data Format","text":"{\n    \"Generators\": {\n        \"gen1\": {\n            \"Bus\": \"b1\",\n            \"Production cost curve (MW)\": [100.0, 110.0, 130.0, 135.0],\n            \"Production cost curve ($)\": [1400.0, 1600.0, 2200.0, 2400.0],\n            \"Startup costs ($)\": [300.0, 400.0],\n            \"Startup delays (h)\": [1, 4],\n            \"Ramp up limit (MW)\": 232.68,\n            \"Ramp down limit (MW)\": 232.68,\n            \"Startup limit (MW)\": 232.68,\n            \"Shutdown limit (MW)\": 232.68,\n            \"Minimum downtime (h)\": 4,\n            \"Minimum uptime (h)\": 4,\n            \"Initial status (h)\": 12,\n            \"Must run?\": false,\n            \"Reserve eligibility\": [\"r1\"],\n        },\n        \"gen2\": {\n            \"Bus\": \"b5\",\n            \"Production cost curve (MW)\": [0.0, [10.0, 8.0, 0.0, 3.0]],\n            \"Production cost curve ($)\": [0.0, 0.0],\n            \"Reserve eligibility\": [\"r1\", \"r2\"],\n        }\n    }\n}","category":"page"},{"location":"format/#Price-sensitive-loads","page":"Data Format","title":"Price-sensitive loads","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"format/","page":"Data Format","title":"Data Format","text":"This section describes components in the system which may increase or reduce their energy consumption according to the energy prices.
